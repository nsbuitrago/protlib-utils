# Protein Library Utils

A collection of scripts for various protein engineering tasks

- add_adapters.py: Add flanking adapters to a library
- heatmap.py: Generate a heatmap of amino acid frequencies for a given library
- make_rand_gradient_lib.py: Generate a randomized library with varying mutations
- pool.py: Pool individual libraries together
- get_lib_entropy.py: Calculate the entropy of a library

All scripts can be run from the command line with the `-h` flag to see the available options.
Alternatively, you can import functions from these scripts for programmatic use.

## Installation

I have not packaged this yet. So, for now, you can just clone the repository and
install dependencies with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (or another package manager).
